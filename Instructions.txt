1. To compile the code yourself, import this project into Eclipse.
>> If only the source files are found, download the JavaCV .jars from 

	*https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv

   AS WELL AS missing classes as detailed in issue #225 of javacpp in

	*https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/files/290338/ffmpeg-3.0.2-1.2-fixed.zip

   and follow the classpath linking instructions in the first link (Project -> Properties -> Java Build Path -> Libraries tab -> Add External JARs). The project uses the following .jars:

	* ffmpeg-3.0.2-1.2.jar
	* ffmpeg-windows-x86.jar
	* javacpp.jar
	* javacv.jar
	* opencv-windows-x86.jar

2. Once imported, run one of either program (MainPic or MainVid).

3. Follow the on-screen prompts.

A valid set of inputs for MainPic would be as follows:

Image1.jpg		// loads Image1.jpg
Image2.jpg		// loads Image2.jpg
0			// measures the distance between the two images in grayscale 			   		   form

----------

A valid set of inputs for MainVid would be as follows:

Beijing.avi		// loads Beijing.avi
1500			// sets the isolated keyframe difference threshold to 1200
20000			// sets the cumulative keyframe difference threshold to 20000
n			// disables frame-by-frame reports (Prev RGB, KF RGB, cumulative 			   diffs)
